# To-Do:
- change goblin speed and AI
- fix potions
- fix being werewolf transformation (when losing control) (e.g. on death)
- make custom hand renderer
- make particle effects on player/villager transformation
- add events
- fix entities vanishing when too far away
- fix werewolf no control thing
- (make that you don't get hunger effect when having no control)
- when no control werewolf kills mob, also make (sure) that player gets 10 instead of 5 xp
(- and make sure that no control werewolves have to kill and not only hurt the mob to get xp)
- make that no control werewolves can't get xp and remove the above two tasks
- make no control thing only for level 0 without xp
