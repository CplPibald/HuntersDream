# Hunter's Dream
## What is "Hunter's Dream" ?
Hunter's Dream Mod is a minecraft modification which adds majority of folklore monsters, magic, dimensions and adds it's own minecraft religion of some sorts! This mod also adds vehicles and weaponary which range from the common crossbow to a SniperRifle! You can also become some of these creatures if hunting monsters isn't your thing and each come with their own leveling system and skill trees. To name a few examples: Werewolves, Vampires, Ghosts, Ghouls, Merfolk, Skinwalkers, Weredogs and Hellhounds (Maybe even become a Demon or Angel ;P)  

In this mod, this also adds an afterlife system. Depending on what you do in the overworld, you'll either respawn in the Overworld or The Divine world or The 2nd Nether. The main idea of this is to make players think about what they're doing and care about dying and think twice on their actions, making the game be more or less like "Everything you do has two outcomes, the intention of the outcome and the consequence".
